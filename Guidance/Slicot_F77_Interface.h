C     To find a controllable realization for the linear time-invariant
C     single-input system
C
C             dX/dt = A * X + B * U,
C
C     where A is an N-by-N matrix and B is an N element vector which
C     are reduced by this routine to orthogonal canonical form using
C     (and optionally accumulating) orthogonal similarity
C     transformations.
C
C     ARGUMENTS
C
C     Mode Parameters
C
C     JOBZ    CHARACTER*1
C             Indicates whether the user wishes to accumulate in a
C             matrix Z the orthogonal similarity transformations for
C             reducing the system, as follows:
C             = 'N':  Do not form Z and do not store the orthogonal
C                     transformations;
C             = 'F':  Do not form Z, but store the orthogonal
C                     transformations in the factored form;
C             = 'I':  Z is initialized to the unit matrix and the
C                     orthogonal transformation matrix Z is returned.
C
C     Input/Output Parameters
C
C     N       (input) INTEGER
C             The order of the original state-space representation,
C             i.e. the order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
C
C     A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
C             On entry, the leading N-by-N part of this array must
C             contain the original state dynamics matrix A.
C             On exit, the leading NCONT-by-NCONT upper Hessenberg
C             part of this array contains the canonical form of the
C             state dynamics matrix, given by Z' * A * Z, of a
C             controllable realization for the original system. The
C             elements below the first subdiagonal are set to zero.
C
C     LDA     INTEGER
C             The leading dimension of array A.  LDA >= MAX(1,N).
C
C     B       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
C             On entry, the original input/state vector B.
C             On exit, the leading NCONT elements of this array contain
C             canonical form of the input/state vector, given by Z' * B,

C

C             The order of the controllable state-space representation.
C
C     Z       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDZ,N)
C             If JOBZ = 'I', then the leading N-by-N part of this array
C             contains the matrix of accumulated orthogonal similarity
C             transformations which reduces the given system to
C             orthogonal canonical form.
C             If JOBZ = 'F', the elements below the diagonal, with the
C             array TAU, represent the orthogonal transformation matrix
C             as a product of elementary reflectors. The transformation
C             matrix can then be obtained by calling the LAPACK Library
C             routine DORGQR.
C             If JOBZ = 'N', the array Z is not referenced and can be
C             supplied as a dummy array (i.e. set parameter LDZ = 1 and
C             declare this array to be Z(1,1) in the calling program).
C
C     LDZ     INTEGER
C             The leading dimension of array Z. If JOBZ = 'I' or
C             JOBZ = 'F', LDZ >= MAX(1,N); if JOBZ = 'N', LDZ >= 1.
C
C     TAU     (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
C             The elements of TAU contain the scalar factors of the
C             elementary reflectors used in the reduction of B and A.
C
C     Tolerances
C
C     TOL     DOUBLE PRECISION
C             The tolerance to be used in determining the
C             controllability of (A,B). If the user sets TOL > 0, then
C             the given value of TOL is used as an absolute tolerance;
C             elements with absolute value less than TOL are considered
C             neglijible. If the user sets TOL <= 0, then an implicitly
C             computed, default tolerance, defined by
C             TOLDEF = N*EPS*MAX( NORM(A), NORM(B) ) is used instead,
C             where EPS is the machine precision (see LAPACK Library
C             routine DLAMCH).
C
C     Workspace
C
C     DWORK   DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDWORK)
C             On exit, if INFO = 0, DWORK(1) returns the optimal value
C             of LDWORK.
C
C     LDWORK  INTEGER
C             The length of the array DWORK. LDWORK >= MAX(1,N).
C             For optimum performance LDWORK should be larger.
C
C     Error Indicator
C
C     INFO    INTEGER
C             = 0:  successful exit;
C             < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal
C                   value.
C
C     METHOD
C
C     The Householder matrix which reduces all but the first element
C     of vector B to zero is found and this orthogonal similarity
C     transformation is applied to the matrix A. The resulting A is then
C     reduced to upper Hessenberg form by a sequence of Householder
C     transformations. Finally, the order of the controllable state-
C     space representation (NCONT) is determined by finding the position
C     of the first sub-diagonal element of A which is below an
C     appropriate zero threshold, either TOL or TOLDEF (see parameter
C     TOL); if NORM(B) is smaller than this threshold, NCONT is set to
C     zero, and no computations for reducing the system to orthogonal
C     canonical form are performed.

C
C     TOL     DOUBLE PRECISION
C             The tolerance to be used in rank determination when

C                   value.
C
C     METHOD
C
C     Matrix B is first QR-decomposed and the appropriate orthogonal
C     similarity transformation applied to the matrix A. Leaving the
C     first rank(B) states unchanged, the remaining lower left block
C     of A is then QR-decomposed and the new orthogonal matrix, Q1,
C     is also applied to the right of A to complete the similarity
C     transformation. By continuing in this manner, a completely
C     controllable state-space pair (Acont, Bcont) is found for the
C     given (A, B), where Acont is upper block Hessenberg with each
C     subdiagonal block of full row rank, and Bcont is zero apart from
C     its (independent) first rank(B) rows.
C     NOTE that the system controllability indices are easily
C     calculated from the dimensions of the blocks of Acont.

C     where the blocks  B1, A21, ..., Ap,p-1  have full row ranks and
C     p is the controllability index of the pair.  The size of the
C     block Auncont is equal to the dimension of the uncontrollable

C     canonical form (see SLICOT library routine AB01ND). The blocks
C     B1, A21, ..., Ap,p-1 are further reduced in a second, "backward"
C     stage to upper triangular form using RQ factorization. Each of
C     these stages is optional.

C             the calling program).
C

C             KSTAIR is input if STAGES = 'B', and output otherwise.
C
C     Tolerances
C
C     TOL     DOUBLE PRECISION
C             The tolerance to be used in rank determination when
C             transforming (A, B). If the user sets TOL > 0, then
C             the given value of TOL is used as a lower bound for the
C             reciprocal condition number (see the description of the
C             argument RCOND in the SLICOT routine MB03OD);  a
C             (sub)matrix whose estimated condition number is less than
C             1/TOL is considered to be of full rank.  If the user sets
C             TOL <= 0, then an implicitly computed, default tolerance,
C             defined by  TOLDEF = N*N*EPS,  is used instead, where EPS
C             is the machine precision (see LAPACK Library routine
C             DLAMCH).
C             TOL is not referenced if STAGES = 'B'.

C     DWORK   DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDWORK)
C             On exit, if INFO = 0, DWORK(1) returns the optimal value
C             of LDWORK.
C
C     LDWORK  INTEGER
C             The length of the array DWORK.
C             If STAGES <> 'B', LDWORK >= MAX(1, N + MAX(N,3*M));
C             If STAGES =  'B', LDWORK >= MAX(1, M + MAX(N,M)).
C             For optimum performance LDWORK should be larger.
C
C     Error Indicator
C
C     INFO    INTEGER
C             = 0:  successful exit;
C             < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal
C                   value.
C
C     METHOD
C
C     Staircase reduction of the pencil [B|sI - A] is used. Orthogonal
C     transformations U and V are constructed such that
C
C
C                        |B |sI-A      *  . . .  *      *       |

C                        |  |  A    sI-A    .    .      .       |
C                        |  |   21      22    .  .      .       |
C                        |  |        .     .     *      *       |
C     [U'BV|sI - U'AU] = |0 |     0    .     .                  |
C                        |  |            A     sI-A     *       |
C                        |  |             p,p-1    pp           |
C                        |  |                                   |
C                        |0 |         0          0   sI-A       |
C                        |  |                            p+1,p+1|
C
C
C     where the i-th diagonal block of U'AU has dimension KSTAIR(i),
C     for i = 1,...,p. The value of p is returned in INDCON. The last
C     block contains the uncontrollable modes of the (A,B)-pair which
C     are also the generalized eigenvalues of the above pencil.
C
C     The complete reduction is performed in two stages. The first,
C     forward stage accomplishes the reduction to the orthogonal
C     canonical form. The second, backward stage consists in further
C     reduction to triangular form by applying left and right orthogonal
C     transformations.

		C     METHOD
		C
		C     After cascaded inter-connection of the two systems
		C
		C     X1'     = A1*X1 + B1*U
		C     V       = C1*X1 + D1*U
		C
		C     X2'     = A2*X2 + B2*V
		C     Y       = C2*X2 + D2*V
		C
		C     (where  '  denotes differentiation with respect to time)
		C
		C     the following state-space model will be obtained:
		C
		C     X'      = A*X + B*U
		C     Y       = C*X + D*U
		C
		C     where matrix  A  has the form   ( A1     0 ),
		C                                     ( B2*C1  A2)
		C
		C           matrix  B  has the form  (  B1   ),
		C                                    ( B2*D1 )
		C
		C           matrix  C  has the form  ( D2*C1  C2 ) and
		C
		C           matrix  D  has the form  ( D2*D1 ).
		C
		C     This form is returned by the routine when UPLO = 'L'.  Note that
		C     when A1 and A2 are block lower triangular, the resulting state
		C     matrix is also block lower triangular.
		C
		C     By applying a similarity transformation to the system above,
		C     using the matrix  ( 0  I ),  where  I  is the identity matrix of
		C                       ( J  0 )
		C     order  N2,  and  J  is the identity matrix of order  N1,  the
		C     system matrices become
		C
		C           A = ( A2  B2*C1 ),
		C               ( 0     A1  )
		C
		C           B = ( B2*D1 ),
		C               (  B1   )
		C
		C           C = ( C2  D2*C1 ) and
		C
		C           D = ( D2*D1 ).
		C
		C     This form is returned by the routine when UPLO = 'U'.  Note that
		C     when A1 and A2 are block upper triangular (for instance, in the
		C     real Schur form), the resulting state matrix is also block upper
		C     triangular.

		C     METHOD
		C
		C     The matrices of the closed-loop system have the expressions:
		C
		C     Ac = A1 + beta*B1*K,      Bc = B1*G,
		C     Cc = H*(C1 + beta*D1*K),  Dc = H*D1*G,
		C
		C     where
		C
		C     A1 = A + alpha*B*F*E*C,   B1 = B + alpha*B*F*E*D,
		C     C1 = E*C,                 D1 = E*D,
		C
		C     with E = (I - alpha*D*F)**-1.
		C
		C     NUMERICAL ASPECTS
		C
		C     The accuracy of computations basically depends on the conditioning
		C     of the matrix I - alpha*D*F. If RCOND is very small, it is likely
		C     that the computed results are inaccurate.

		C
		C     INFO    INTEGER

		C                   value;
		C             = i:  the matrix D is exactly singular; the (i,i) diagonal
		C                   element is zero, i <= M; RCOND was set to zero;
		C             = M+1:  the matrix D is numerically singular, i.e., RCOND
		C                   is less than the relative machine precision, EPS
		C                   (see LAPACK Library routine DLAMCH). The
		C                   calculations have been completed, but the results
		C                   could be very inaccurate.
		C
		C     METHOD
		C
		C     The matrices of the inverse system are computed with the formulas:
		C                   -1              -1         -1           -1
		C       Ai = A - B*D  *C,  Bi = -B*D  ,  Ci = D  *C,  Di = D  .
		C
		C     NUMERICAL ASPECTS
		C
		C     The accuracy depends mainly on the condition number of the matrix
		C     D to be inverted. The estimated reciprocal condition number is
		C     returned in RCOND.

		C     reduction method. The state dynamics matrix A of the original
		C     system is an upper quasi-triangular matrix in real Schur canonical
		C     form. The matrices of the reduced order system are computed using
		C     the truncation formulas:

		C     (A,B,C,D) and (Ar,Br,Cr,Dr), respectively, and INFNORM(G) is the
		C     infinity-norm of G.

		C     If JOB = 'B', the balancing-based square-root SPA method of [1]

		C     is used.
		C     By setting TOL1 = TOL2, the routine can be used to compute
